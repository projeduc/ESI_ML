Lab05: Neural Networks
=======================

In this lab, we will learn about neural networks (NN). We will implement backpropagation to understand how a NN works.
Then, we will test many concepts:
- Parameters' initialization
- Activation functions effect
- Optimization functions for NN


TOOLS:
------
Python, Jupyter, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, tensorflow

DATASETS:
---------
