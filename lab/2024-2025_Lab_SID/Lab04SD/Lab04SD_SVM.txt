Lab04: Support Vectors Machines and optimization
================================================

Students must implement and analyze the results.
In this lab, our goal is to understand how SVM works by implementing the two formulations: primal and dual.
The implementation allows us to discover some advantages and disadvantages of the two formulations.
Additionally, we will see stochastic optimization.
In the "analysis" part, we will carry out some experiments to test some theoretical notions.

TOOLS:
------
Python, Jupyter, pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, timeit
