Lab06. Regularization and Feature selection
============================================

Students must implement and analyze the results.
In this lab, our goal is to understand how data regularization and filtering work.
To do this, we need to implement two regularization functions for regression: L2 and L1.
Concerning fatures selection, we must implement a filtering algorithm: ANOVA

TOOLS: 
------
Python, Jupyter, pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, timeit

DATASETS: 
---------
Diabetics prediction using logistic regression.

PLAN: 
-----
I. Algorithms implementation
    - I.1. L2 penalty
    - I.2. L1 penalty
    - I.3. Regularized logistic regression
    - I.4. Filtering (ANOVA: Analysis of Variance)
II. Application and Analsis
    - II.1. Régularisation
    - II.2. Sélection d'attributs
