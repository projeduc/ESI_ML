Lab02: Naive Bayes
===================

In this lab, we will learn about Naive Bayes by testing 2 implementations:
    - Multinomial Naïve Bayes
    - Gaussian Naïve Bayes

TOOLS:
------
Python, Jupyter, pandas, scikit-learn, numpy

DATASETS:
---------
SMS Spam Collection Dataset

    I.1. Prior statistics
    I.2. Multinomial Law
    I.3. Normal (Gaussian) Law
    I.4. Multinomial prediction
    I.5. Final product
II. Application and Analsis
    II.1. Prior probability
    II.2. Smoothing
    II.3. Naive Bayes performance

WHAT TO DO:
-----------
I. Algorithms implementation
    - Prior statistics                  [4pts]
    - Multinomial Likelihood statistics [4pts]
    - Multinomial Likelihood prediction [4pts]
    - Gaussian Likelihood statistics    [4pts]
    - Gaussian Likelihood prediction    [4pts]
    - Final prediction                  [4pts]

II. Application and Analsis
    - Prior probability                 [8pts = 2 + 4 + 2]
    - Smoothing                         [12pts = 2 + 4 + 2 + 4]
    - Naive Bayes performance           [20pts = 2 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 ]
