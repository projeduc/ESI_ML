% Karel Mokry:
%   16.11.2000 version 1.0
%     - first released version
%   06.11.2001 version 1.1
%     - problems with output fixed -- looked 'broken'
%     - output from verses.sty was full of garbage
%       [reported by Daddi Addoun Yacine]
%
% Otakar Smrz:
%   23.05.2007 version 1.2
%     - reimplemented using xcolor
%     - new syntax and extended sets
%     - local scope of coloring
%   19.06.2007 version 1.3
%     - \acoloron, \noacolor, \acolorlet, and \acolor
%       are now allowed as part of the input notation
%       [reported by Torsten Nieland]
%     - explicit \nospace is generally needed in case
%       of intervening space between groups of glyphs
%     - minor bug fix in acolor names
%   27.07.2014 version 1.4
%     - fixed the tatwils generated while \spreadtrue
%       [reported by Alioune Diagne and George Kamel]
%     - enabled the coloring of 'tatwil' and 'others'
%       and included these groups within 'everything'
%       [reported by George Kamel]
%     - fixed the vertical misalignment of syllables
%     - internally using \color instead of \textcolor
%     - \color and \colorlet are now allowed as part
%       of the input notation to account for coloring
%       the current paragraph if \noacolor is applied
